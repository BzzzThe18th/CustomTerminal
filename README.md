# Custom Terminal

Custom terminal is a Lethal Company BepInEx mod that allows for the customization of the ui, lighting and settings of the terminal. I probably haven't added the color of all the objects necessary as I've only been able to test inside of the ship at the moment, if you find something, ping me.

# Custom Terminal

Custom terminal allows for the customization of the ui, lighting and settings of the terminal. I probably haven't added the color of all the objects necessary as I've only been able to test inside of the ship at the moment, if you find something, ping me.

## All Config Options

- main color theme
- ui transparency
- ui gamer rgb mode
- light intensity
- light gamer rgb mode
- light persistence (outside of terminal)
- gamer rgb speed
- monitor screen persistence (outside of terminal)
- custom wallpaper
- wallpaper rgb gamer mode

All of these options are found in the configuration file, I may add custom commands to change them later on.
